# How to do an reliable performance test
## How to represent an reliable performance analysis Data
    * Use Average or Mean
    * Use Median
    * Use percentile
        A percentile gives us a much bettern sense of the real world performance, because it shows us a slice of the reponse time curve.
###  Why not Average/Mean
    * the average salary
        There is a artical which is explaining that the average salary in a certain region in Europe was 1900 Euros. However, when looking closer we found out that majority, namely 9 out of 10 people,ony earned around 1000 Euros and one woould earn 10,000. 1900 doesn't represent the "average" salay.right?
    * the average reponse time
    
    * Heavy outlier data
### Percentiles
    * Near to the Real world performance
    * Great for tuning
